# About Me
虚步, a Ph.D. student at BUPT. I am very fortunate to be advised by my advisor. My research is in the area of Vision and Language with a focus on Visual Dialogue. In particular, I am interested in building a visually-grounded conversational AI (social robot) that can see the world and talk with humans in natural language. Other interests include Language Grounding, Visual Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Visual Question Generation and Visual Dialog based Referring Expression.

<b>Now I'm doing research on GuessWhich and Visual Dialog(VisDial)</b>, please feel free to concat me with pangweitf@bupt.edu.cn or pangweitf@163.com if you have any questions or concerns.

# GuessWhich
GuessWhich is an image guessing game between two agents: Q-BOT and A-BOT, like that of GuessWhat?! game that is an object guessing game between two players.

The two agents communicate in natural language dialogue. Beginning of the dialog, they are faced with a large set of images, in which ABot randomly selects an image as the secret that is not known to Q-BOT. Q-Bot asks a sequence of free-form nature language questions and ABot responds with free-form answers. In the end QBot tries to identify the secret image from fixed pool of images. If the right image is found, the dialogue is considered a success, elsewise, failure.

# Challenges
GuessWhich is a more fundamental and challenging problem in Vision and Language tasks. It involves processing large amounts of images, and human's mental imagery that is spawned by a nature language Question-Answer-pairs.

I'm looking for someone who like this challenging problem, please don't hesitate to contact me if you intend to work with me.
