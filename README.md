# About Me
虚步, a Ph.D. student at BUPT. I am very fortunate to be advised by my advisor. My research is in the area of Vision, Language and Reasoning, currently with a focus on Visual Dialogue. In particular, I am interested in building a visually-grounded conversational AI (social robot) agents that can see the world around them, can talk with us with natural language. Other interests include Visual/Language Grounding, Visual Reasoning, Visual Question Generation and Visually-grounded Referring Expression.

<b>Now I'm doing research on GuessWhich and Visual Dialog(VisDial)</b>, please feel free to concat me via pangweitf@bupt.edu.cn or pangweitf@163.com if you have any questions or concerns.

# GuessWhich
GuessWhich is a cooperative image-guessing game between two agents: Q-BOT and A-BOT, like that of GuessWhat?! game that is an image object-guessing game between two players.

The two agents communicate in natural language dialogue. At the beginning, they are presented with a large set of images, in which ABot randomly selects an image as the secret that is not known to Q-BOT. Q-Bot asks a sequence of free-form natural language questions and ABot responds with free-form answers. In the end QBot tries to identify the secret image from the fixed pool of images. If the right image is found, the dialogue is considered a success, elsewise, failure.

## Challenges
GuessWhich is a more fundamental and challenging problem in Vision-and-Language-and-Reasoning tasks. It involves processing large amounts of images, and human's mental imagery that is spawned by a nature language dialog that consists of multi-round Question-Answer-pairs.

<b>I'm looking for someone who are interested in this challenging problem, please don't hesitate to contact me if you intend to exchange ideas with me.</b>
