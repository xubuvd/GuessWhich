#GuessWhich
GuessWhich is an image guessing game between two agents: Q-BOT and A-BOT, like that of GuessWhat?! game that is an object guessing game between two players.

The two agents communicate in natural language dialogue. Beginning of the dialog, they are faced with a large set of images, in which ABot randomly selects an image as the secret that is not known by Q-BOT. Q-Bot asks a sequence of free-form nature language questions and ABot responds with free-form answers. In the end QBot tries to identify the secret image from fixed pool of images. If the right image is found, the dialogue is considered a success, elsewise, failure.
